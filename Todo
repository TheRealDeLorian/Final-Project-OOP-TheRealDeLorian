Make courses more usable

1. MAKE FILES
2. Make a method that can read the file and turn it into a hashtable of course classes
3. add error message for invalid id



********USER FEEDBACK********

--When I first went to add a class it only popped up with one of them until I went back in to add classes and then they all showed up, I was also able to continuously add the same class over and over again and it would keep adding it to my schedule. HALF RESOLVED -- now only repeats courses when you go through the menu twice


***********RESOLVED***********

--Too much white space at the bottom of your UI.

--pressed 1 and nothing happened
Yet another user said "Saved my schedule. Was there again after exit and running again." So IDK what to think. I just tested it and it still works
