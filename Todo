pressed 1 and nothing happened


Handled too long of ID wellâ€¦
Handled invalid data well.
Saved my schedule. Was there again after exit and running again.


When I first went to add a class it only popped up with one of them until I went back in to add classes and then they all showed up, I was also able to continuously add the same class over and over again and it would keep adding it to my schedule. 


 Too much white space at the bottom of your UI.
